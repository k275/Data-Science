    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) that allows you to hide the implementation details of a class or an object and expose only the necessary information or functionality to the users. In other words, Abstraction provides a simplified view of a complex system by reducing the complexity of its internal workings.\n",

    "In Python, Abstraction can be achieved using Abstract Classes and Interfaces. Abstract classes are the classes that cannot be instantiated and contain one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that does not have any implementation in the abstract class, but it must be implemented by the subclasses. Abstract classes are defined using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of abstraction using an abstract class in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.side * self.side\n",
    "\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        return 4 * self.side\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "s = Square(5)\n",
    "print(\"Area of square:\", s.area())\n",
    "print(\"Perimeter of square:\", s.perimeter())\n",
    "\n",
    "c = Circle(7)\n",
    "print(\"Area of circle:\", c.area())\n",
    "print(\"Perimeter of circle:\", c.perimeter())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have an abstract class Shape with two abstract methods area() and perimeter(). The Square and Circle classes inherit from the Shape class and provide their own implementations of the area() and perimeter() methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using an abstract class, we can ensure that any class that wants to be a Shape must implement the area() and perimeter() methods. We can also use the Shape class as a type hint to indicate that a variable should be of a shape type, without needing to know the specifics of the implementation. This way, we can achieve Abstraction in our program, which allows us to work with simplified interfaces instead of complex implementations."

    "Abstraction and Encapsulation are two important concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that are often confused with each other, but they have different meanings and purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class or an object and exposing only the necessary information or functionality to the users. It provides a simplified view of a complex system by reducing the complexity of its internal workings. Abstraction can be achieved using Abstract Classes, Interfaces, or other mechanisms that allow you to define a simplified interface to a complex system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is the process of binding the data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is not accessible from outside the object, except through the methods provided by the class. It protects the data from unauthorized access or modification and makes the class more robust, secure, and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, Abstraction is about hiding complexity and providing a simplified interface, while Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods together and protecting the data from outside interference.\n",
